#First of all...
print("Hello world!") 

#This is called a comment. You can use "comment out" to leave a message for other programmers.

#let's make some variable and play with them!
#Python makes things easy. You can just claim variables without extra signs such as $ or var...beautiful, isn't it?
a = 5000
b = 2000

#basic number handling
print(a + b) 
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b) 

#knowing the data type is important.
print(type(a))

#what about this?
c = str(a)
print(c)

#what do you think will happen?
print(b + c)

#I would like you to add b + c. How can you do that? Write your answer below.
